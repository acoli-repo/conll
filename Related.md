- [Terminal-based CoNLL-file viewer](https://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/repository/xmlui/handle/11234/1-2514) (last version 2017, probably CoNLL-U only)
- [TARQL](https://tarql.github.io/) small library for converting CSV formats into RDF using SPARQL. Can be used as an alternative to the CoNLL-RDF Stream Extractor for cases where no relations between rows are required (e.g., for lexical data).
