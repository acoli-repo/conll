## Visualization of CoNLL/TSV data

- [Terminal-based CoNLL-file viewer](https://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/repository/xmlui/handle/11234/1-2514) (last version 2017, probably CoNLL-U only)

## Parsing of CoNLL/TSV data into RDF

- [survey article](https://medium.com/datafabric/a-practical-review-of-non-rdf-to-rdf-converters-51686338927f) about CSV-to-RDF parsers (2018)
- [TARQL](https://tarql.github.io/) small library for converting CSV formats into RDF using SPARQL. Can be used as an alternative to the CoNLL-RDF Stream Extractor for cases where no relations between rows are required (e.g., for lexical data).
